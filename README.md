My friends wanted an automated drinking game.  Boom.

*** Warning ***

This circuit uses high voltage power and should only by wired by a qualified electrician.  Safe assembly and operation of this project is the userâ€™s responsibility. 

Also, don't be an idiot and use a solenoid valve that isn't rated for food use (I see you shopping in the sprinkler section at Home Depot.)  Use a dishwasher or refrigerator water valve.
